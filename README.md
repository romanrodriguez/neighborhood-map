# Front-End Nanodegree Neighborhood Map

## Project Overview
Single-page application featuring a map of some of my favorite locations in the Bay Area, as well as a list of the top 50 locations for a particular area of Palo Alto provided by Foursquare. This application includes map markers to identify the places I like to visit, a search function to easily discover more locations, and a listview to support simple browsing of all these locations. You can also draw an area with the drawing tools to discover new places, search for other locations, calculate distances and search for anything nearby.
